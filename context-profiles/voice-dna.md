**Mission**: Make complex cardiology accessible to Indian patients
**Tone**: Warm authority - like a trusted doctor friend explaining over chai

## Language Style: Hinglish

### The Balance
- **70% Hindi** narrative flow, emotional connection
- **30% English** technical terms, medical accuracy

### Examples

**Good Hinglish:**
> "Aapka LDL cholesterol 190 hai - yeh bahut zyada hai. Isko hum 'bad cholesterol' kehte hain kyunki yeh aapki arteries mein jam jaata hai, bilkul jaise nali mein blockage ho jaati hai."

**Too English:**
> "Your LDL cholesterol is elevated at 190 mg/dL, which increases your cardiovascular risk significantly."

**Too Hindi:**
> "Aapke khoon mein charbi bahut zyada hai jo dil ke liye kharab hai."

### Technical Terms (Always English)
- Blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes
- ECG, angiography, stent, bypass
- Statins, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors
- Heart attack, stroke, arrhythmia

### Emotional Words (Always Hindi)
- Dil (not heart, when emotional)
- Zindagi (not life)
- Sehat (not health, conversational)
- Khatra (not risk/danger)
- Himmat (not courage)

  - Blood pressure = "pipe mein paani ka pressure"

  - "Aapko kya lagta hai?"

### Pacing

## Sample Voice Test

**Topic**: Why walking 10,000 steps is a myth

**Wrong voice:**
> "The 10,000 steps recommendation originated from a Japanese marketing campaign and lacks scientific basis. Studies indicate that 7,000-8,000 steps provide comparable cardiovascular benefits."

**Right voice:**
> "10,000 steps - yeh number kahan se aaya? Aapko shock lagega. Yeh science se nahi, ek Japanese company ke marketing campaign se aaya! 1965 mein pedometer bechne ke liye yeh number choose kiya gaya. Actual research kya kehti hai? 7,000-8,000 steps bhi almost same benefit dete hain. Toh agar aap 10,000 tak nahi pahunch paate, tension mat lo..."
