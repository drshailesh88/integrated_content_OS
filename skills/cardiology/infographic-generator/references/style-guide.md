# Infographic Style Guide (Brand-Aligned)

These are the minimum style constraints for this system.

## Layout
- Portrait 1080x1350 by default.
- Use card-based sections with consistent padding.
- Limit to 4-7 sections to avoid crowding.
- Keep primary headline short (max 2 lines).

## Typography
- Use the visual-design-system font tokens (Helvetica/Arial).
- Headline: large and bold. Body: short, scannable bullets.
- Avoid dense paragraphs.

## Color and Contrast
- Use brand tokens from `visual-design-system/tokens/`.
- Maintain high contrast between text and background.
- Use accents sparingly for hierarchy (one primary, one accent).

## Visual Rhythm
- Use icons to anchor bullet lists.
- Prefer 2-column grids for paired comparisons.
- Use subtle gradients or soft background shapes only if they support readability.

## Data Integrity
- Include numeric evidence (HR, CI, NNT, p-values) when relevant.
- Always add source labels when citing trials.
