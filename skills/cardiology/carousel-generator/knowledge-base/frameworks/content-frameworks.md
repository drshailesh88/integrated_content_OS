# Content Frameworks

## Ship 30 for 30 Framework

### 4A Categories
Every piece of content should fit one of these categories:

1. **Actionable** - Practical tips they can use today
2. **Analytical** - Data-driven insights and research
3. **Aspirational** - Motivational, showing what's possible
4. **Anthropological** - Stories and human experiences

### 10 Magical Ways (Content Modifiers)
View any topic through these 10 lenses:

1. **Tips** - "5 Tips for..." (Actionable advice)
2. **Stats** - "The Data Shows..." (Numbers and research)
3. **Steps** - "How to... in 5 Steps" (Process breakdown)
4. **Lessons** - "What I Learned..." (Experience insights)
5. **Examples** - "Case Study:..." (Real scenarios)
6. **Reasons** - "Why X Matters" (The logic behind)
7. **Mistakes** - "Avoid These Errors" (Common pitfalls)
8. **Questions** - "Have You Considered?" (Thought-provoking)
9. **Stories** - "The Patient Who..." (Narrative)
10. **Benefits** - "The Results of..." (Outcomes)

### Headline Formula
`[Number] + [What] + [For Whom] + [Outcome] + [Curiosity]`

Examples:
- "5 Heart Attack Signs Every Diabetic Should Know"
- "3 Foods That Actually Lower Cholesterol (Research Says)"
- "Why Statins Failed This Patient (And What Worked)"

### Skimmability Rhythms
- **1/3/1** - One point, three supporting bullets, one conclusion
- **1/5/1** - Hook, five main points, CTA
- **3/3/3** - Three sections, three points each, three words per key phrase

## Cole GPT Method (Mini-Model Technique)

### Core Principle
User provides first draft → AI generates 5 variations → User picks best elements → Iterate

### 90% Value Rule
90% of content value comes from:
- Headline (hook)
- 3 Main Points (structure)

### Workflow
1. User writes rough draft or bullet points
2. AI generates 5 headline variations
3. User picks best headline
4. AI generates 5 body variations
5. User picks and combines best elements
6. Final polish

## Anti-AI Detection Guidelines

### AVOID (AI Tells)
- "It's important to note that..."
- "In conclusion" / "In summary"
- "Stands as a testament to..."
- "Plays a vital role in..."
- Excessive em dashes (—) - MAX 1 per paragraph
- Rule of three lists everywhere
- "Groundbreaking", "game-changing", "revolutionary"
- "Nestled", "breathtaking", "vibrant tapestry"
- Starting sentences with "So," or "Well,"

### USE (Human Patterns)
- Specific data with actual numbers
- Proper source attribution (journal names)
- Natural, varied sentence lengths
- First-person clinical insights ("In my clinic, I see...")
- Statistics: HR, NNT, CI when available
- Occasional incomplete sentences. Like this.
- Questions to the reader
- Contractions (don't, won't, can't)
- Colloquial transitions ("Look," "Here's the thing," "Thing is,")

### Sentence Variation
- Mix short. Medium length sentences work too. And then throw in a longer sentence that develops the idea more fully before concluding with another short one.
- Never more than 2 sentences in a row with same structure
- Vary paragraph lengths (1-5 sentences)

## YouTube Structure (Hinglish)

### Think School Approach
1. **Thesis Hook** - State the controversial/surprising claim upfront
2. **Data as Plot Points** - Each data point moves the story forward
3. **Logical Flow** - Clear cause → effect → implication
4. **Strong Conclusion** - Tie back to thesis with actionable insight

### Neelesh Misra Pacing
1. **Empathetic Start** - Connect emotionally first
2. **Simple Hindustani** - Hindi narrative, English for technical terms
3. **Strategic Pauses** - Let important points sink in
4. **Warm Tone** - Like talking to a friend

### Language Balance
- 70% Hindi (narrative, emotion, flow)
- 30% English (medical terms, data, precision)

### Opening Formula
"Dekhiye..." followed by:
- A surprising statistic
- A patient story
- A common misconception

## Thread Structure (Twitter)

### Hook Tweet
- Strong statement or question
- Numbers or specific claim
- Create curiosity gap

### Body Tweets (3-7)
- One idea per tweet
- Build on previous tweet
- Use line breaks for readability

### Closing Tweet
- Summarize key insight
- Clear CTA (Follow, Retweet, Comment)
- Link to resource if applicable

### Thread Types
1. **Story Thread** - Personal/patient narrative with lessons
2. **Framework Thread** - Step-by-step process or system
3. **Myth-Busting Thread** - Common beliefs vs. evidence
