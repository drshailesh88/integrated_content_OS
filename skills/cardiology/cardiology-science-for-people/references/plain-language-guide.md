# Plain Language Guide

Comprehensive vocabulary translations for converting medical writing to accessible science.

## Core Principle

Every medical term exists for precision. But precision between doctors is different from precision for patients. Your job is to preserve the MEANING while changing the WORDS.

## Statistical Terms

| Medical | Plain | Example Translation |
|---------|-------|---------------------|
| hazard ratio (HR) | risk comparison | "HR 0.80 means 20% lower risk" → "about 1 in 5 fewer events" |

| number needed to harm (NNH) | people treated for one to be harmed | "NNH 100" → "1 in 100 had a side effect" |
| confidence interval | range of likely true values | "95% CI 0.72-0.90" → "probably between 10% and 28% benefit" |
| p-value | chance result is coincidence | "p<0.001" → "very strong evidence" or just omit |
| statistically significant | unlikely to be random | "the difference was real, not just chance" |
| median | middle value | "about half above, half below" |
| mean | average | "on average" |
| incidence | new cases | "how many new cases appeared" |
| prevalence | total cases | "how many people have it" |

## Medications

| polypharmacy | taking many medications |
| adverse event | side effect |
| serious adverse event | major side effect |
| contraindicated | shouldn't be used |
| off-label | using drug for something it wasn't approved for |
| first-line therapy | first choice treatment |
| second-line therapy | backup treatment |

## Clinical Terms

| Medical | Plain |
|---------|-------|
| prognosis | likely outcome |
| morbidity | illness, suffering |
| mortality | death |
| all-cause mortality | death from any cause |
| cardiovascular mortality | death from heart or blood vessel problems |

## Framing Statistics for People

### Converting Hazard Ratios

| HR | Meaning | People-friendly phrasing |
|----|---------|-------------------------|
| 0.50 | 50% lower | "cut the risk in half" |
| 0.65 | 35% lower | "about a third less likely" |
| 0.75 | 25% lower | "roughly a quarter less likely" |
| 0.80 | 20% lower | "about 1 in 5 fewer events" |
| 0.85 | 15% lower | "about 15% less likely" |
| 0.90 | 10% lower | "about 1 in 10 fewer events" |
| 1.00 | no difference | "no real difference" |
| 1.20 | 20% higher | "about 1 in 5 more likely" |
| 1.50 | 50% higher | "about half again as likely" |
| 2.00 | 100% higher | "twice as likely" |

### Absolute Risk in Human Terms

**Template**: "For every [X] people treated for [time], [Y] fewer had [outcome]."

**Examples**:
- "For every 100 people who took the drug for 3 years, about 3 fewer had heart attacks."
- "If 25 people with heart failure take this medication, about 1 of them will avoid hospitalization."
- "Out of 1,000 people on blood thinners for a year, about 15 will have some bleeding—usually minor."

### Comparisons That Help

Use real-world comparisons when possible:
- "Similar benefit to what you'd get from stopping smoking"
- "Roughly the same risk reduction as taking a statin"
- "The risk is about as high as driving a car for a year"
- "Less dangerous than riding a motorcycle"

## Phrases to Avoid

| Don't write | Write instead |
|-------------|---------------|
| "It is important to note that..." | Just state it |
| "Healthcare providers should consider..." | "Your doctor might consider..." |
| "Patients should be counseled on..." | "This is worth knowing..." |
| "The data suggest..." | "The evidence shows..." or "Studies found..." |
| "In the clinical setting..." | "In practice..." or "When doctors see patients..." |
| "Evidence-based medicine dictates..." | "Based on the research..." |
| "The literature demonstrates..." | "Studies show..." |
| "Per clinical guidelines..." | "Expert recommendations suggest..." |

## Trial Name Handling

### When you must mention a trial

Keep it minimal and parenthetical:
- "A major study called DAPA-HF found..."
- "The largest trial to date (called SELECT) showed..."
- "In a study that followed patients for years..."

### When to skip trial names entirely

Most of the time. Just describe:
- "When researchers tested this in 17,000 patients..."
- "A well-designed study of people with heart failure..."
- "Multiple studies have now confirmed..."

### Acronym expansion

If you must use an acronym, never expect readers to remember it:
- ❌ "The PARADIGM-HF trial showed... Later, PARADIGM-HF also demonstrated..."
- ✅ "A major heart failure study showed... That same research also demonstrated..."
