# Storytelling Patterns for Science Communication

Structures and techniques for turning clinical trials into stories people want to read.

## Core Truth

People don't remember statistics. They remember stories. Your job is to wrap accurate science in memorable narrative.

## The Five Opening Hooks

### 1. The Surprising Reversal

Start with something that contradicts expectations.

**Template**: "[Thing people assume] might actually be wrong. Here's what we're learning..."

**Examples**:
- "For years, we told people with heart disease to avoid fats. Turns out, the type of fat matters far more than we thought."
- "A diabetes drug is now one of the best heart failure treatments we have—even for people without diabetes."
- "Doctors used to believe that fixing blocked arteries always helped patients live longer. The data tell a different story."

**Why it works**: Cognitive dissonance. Readers need to resolve the surprise.

### 2. The Human Moment

Start with a relatable patient scenario.

**Template**: "Imagine you're [situation]. [Problem]. [Question this raises]..."

**Examples**:
- "Imagine you're 68, just had a stent placed in your heart, and you're wondering how long you'll need to take blood thinners. It's a question your doctor asks herself too."
- "You're a weekend warrior who suddenly gets chest pain during a basketball game. Heart attack? Panic attack? Here's how doctors figure it out."
- "Your mom just had her second bout of heart failure. You're wondering if this is the new normal. There's reason for hope."

**Why it works**: Personal stakes. Reader sees themselves.

### 3. The Mystery Opening

Frame the science as a puzzle being solved.

**Template**: "Scientists noticed something strange: [observation]. They set out to understand why."

**Examples**:
- "Researchers noticed that people taking a certain diabetes medication seemed to have fewer heart attacks. It wasn't supposed to work that way. So they designed a study to find out what was happening."
- "For decades, cardiologists puzzled over why some people with blocked arteries never had heart attacks while others with clear arteries did."

**Why it works**: Curiosity. Readers want to solve the puzzle too.

### 4. The "What We Got Wrong" Opening

Admit past mistakes or limitations.

**Template**: "For years, we believed [old thinking]. New evidence is changing that."

**Examples**:
- "For a long time, doctors thought the best way to help heart failure was to make the heart squeeze harder. We were focused on the wrong problem."
- "Cardiologists used to think diet didn't matter much compared to medications. We underestimated food."

**Why it works**: Humility builds trust. Shows science evolves.

### 5. The Consequence Hook

Start with what's at stake.

**Template**: "[Big number] people face [problem]. [What's changing]..."

**Examples**:
- "About 6 million Americans live with heart failure. Until recently, our medications were frustratingly limited. That's finally changing."
- "Every year, 800,000 people in the US have a stroke. A surprising number could have been prevented—if we'd caught a hidden heart problem."

**Why it works**: Scope. Readers understand this matters.

## Narrative Structures

### Structure 1: Problem → Discovery → Meaning

The classic science story arc.

1. **Establish the problem** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - What was the situation before?
   - Why was it frustrating/dangerous/limited?
   - What were people doing about it?

2. **Introduce the discovery** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - What did researchers do?
   - What did they find?
   - Why is it surprising or important?

3. **Land the meaning** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - What changes now?
   - What does this mean for readers?
   - What questions remain?

**Example skeleton**:
> For years, people with [condition] had limited options. [Old approach] helped some, but [limitation]. [Why this mattered].
>
> Then researchers tried something different. In a study of [number] people, they tested [intervention]. After [time], those getting [treatment] were [result]. Even more striking, [secondary finding].
>
> What does this mean for you? If you have [condition], [practical implication]. The evidence is strong enough that [current status]. Worth asking your doctor about.

### Structure 2: Old Belief → Evidence → New Understanding

For pieces that challenge conventional wisdom.

1. **State the old belief** (1 paragraph)
   - What did we used to think?
   - Why did it seem reasonable?

2. **Present the contradicting evidence** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - What studies challenged this?
   - What did they show?
   - How solid is the evidence?

3. **Synthesize new understanding** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - What do we think now?
   - What's the nuance?
   - What remains uncertain?

### Structure 3: Question → Investigation → Answer (Sort Of)

For topics where the answer is nuanced.

1. **Pose the question readers actually have** (1 paragraph)
   - Frame it the way a patient would ask
   - Acknowledge why it matters

2. **Walk through the evidence** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - What have studies shown?
   - What are the competing findings?
   - What explains the differences?

3. **Give the best current answer** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - What's the most accurate summary?
   - For whom does this apply?
   - What caveats matter?

### Structure 4: Person → Problem → Progress

Character-driven narrative (composite patients).

1. **Introduce someone relatable** (1 paragraph)
   - A composite patient representing the population
   - Their specific challenge
   - (Note: Always make clear this is representative, not a specific individual)

2. **Explain their problem in scientific terms** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - What's happening in their body?
   - What were the options?

3. **Show what's changed** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - What new options exist?
   - How does the evidence apply to them?
   - What's the realistic outlook?

## Transitions That Work

### Moving from Story to Science

- "Here's what's actually happening inside..."
- "The science behind this is..."
- "To understand why, we need to look at..."
- "Researchers set out to test this..."

### Moving from Science to Implications

- "In practical terms, this means..."
- "For you, this translates to..."
- "The bottom line for patients is..."
- "What this means for your daily life..."

### Moving from Evidence to Uncertainty

- "What we still don't know is..."
- "The evidence is strongest for... but less clear for..."
- "This works well for [group], but we need more research on..."
- "One thing to keep in mind..."

## Ending Strong

### The Takeaway Close

Summarize the single most important point.

**Template**: "The bottom line: [core message]. [Practical application]."

**Example**: "The bottom line: your cholesterol numbers matter less than the type of cholesterol and what you do about it. If your doctor mentions LDL, it's worth having a real conversation about your options."

### The Forward-Looking Close

Point to what's coming.

**Template**: "This is just the beginning. [What's next]. [Why that matters]."

**Example**: "This is just the beginning. Researchers are now testing whether starting treatment earlier could prevent heart failure from developing in the first place. In a few years, we might be having a very different conversation."

### The Empowerment Close

Give readers something to do.

**Template**: "If [you fit this profile], [specific action]. [Why it's worth it]."

**Example**: "If you have diabetes and are already on a GLP-1 medication, ask your cardiologist whether your heart might be benefiting too. It's a conversation worth having."

### The Perspective Close

Zoom out to larger context.

**Template**: "[What we covered] is part of [bigger picture]. [What this signals]."

**Example**: "This new approach to heart failure reflects something bigger happening in medicine: we're learning to treat the whole system, not just one organ. Your heart, kidneys, and metabolism are more connected than we realized—and that's good news for treatment."

## Things to Avoid

### Don't End With Uncertainty

- ❌ "More research is needed."
- ❌ "The picture isn't clear yet."
- ❌ "Time will tell."

(These are true but unsatisfying. If you must acknowledge uncertainty, pair it with something actionable.)

### Don't End With a Disclaimer

- ❌ "Always consult your doctor before making changes."
- ❌ "This is not medical advice."

(If needed, put this earlier. Don't make it your last impression.)

### Don't Summarize the Summary

- ❌ "In conclusion, we've seen that [repeats everything]."

(Trust your reader. They got it.)

## Tone Calibration

### Match the subject

- **Exciting discovery**: Enthusiasm is okay, but measured ("This is genuinely exciting because...")
- **Nuanced findings**: Thoughtful, balanced ("The answer is more complicated, but that's actually good news...")
- **Overturned belief**: Humble, exploratory ("We got this wrong, and here's what we're learning...")
- **Practical guidance**: Direct, confident ("Here's what the evidence supports...")

### Avoid academic hedge-stacking

- ❌ "It may potentially be possible that some patients might consider..."
- ✅ "For some patients, this could help."

### Show your humanity

Occasional personal observations build trust:
- "This surprised me when I first read the data."
- "I find this both encouraging and a little humbling."
- "What struck me most was..."
