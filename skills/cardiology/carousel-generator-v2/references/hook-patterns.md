# Hook Patterns for Carousel First Slides

High-converting hook patterns for cardiology content.

## The Hook Formula

```
[Pattern] + [Specific Topic] + [Curiosity Gap]
```

**Example:**
- Pattern: "X things you didn't know about..."
- Topic: "LDL cholesterol"
- Curiosity Gap: "that could save your life"

**Result:** "5 things you didn't know about LDL cholesterol that could save your life"

## Hook Categories

### 1. NUMBER HOOKS
The most reliable pattern for engagement.

| X reasons why [action] | 3 reasons why your LDL target is wrong |
| X signs of [condition] | 4 signs of heart disease you're ignoring |

**Best numbers:** 3, 5, 7, 10 (odd numbers outperform even)

| Are you making this [topic] mistake? | Are you making this fatal blood pressure mistake? |

### 3. MYTH-BUSTING HOOKS

| This [topic] myth could kill you | This statin myth could kill you |
| [Authority] got [topic] wrong | The AHA got dietary fat completely wrong |

### 4. FEAR/URGENCY HOOKS

| Warning signs of [condition] | Warning signs your arteries are clogged |
| Before it's too late | What to do before your next heart attack |
| This mistake is deadly | This blood pressure mistake is deadly |

### 5. AUTHORITY HOOKS
Leverage credibility and trust.

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| What [expert] wishes you knew | What cardiologists wish you knew about statins |
| [Study] just revealed | The CLEAR trial just revealed something shocking |
| New research shows | New research shows exercise beats medication |
| As a [credential], I must warn you | As a cardiologist, I must warn you about this |
| Inside [institution/trial] | Inside the trial that changed cardiology forever |

### 6. CONTRARIAN HOOKS
Challenge mainstream views (with evidence).

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Why [mainstream advice] is wrong | Why "low-fat" advice was completely wrong |
| [Common practice] doesn't work | Why exercise alone doesn't lower cholesterol |
