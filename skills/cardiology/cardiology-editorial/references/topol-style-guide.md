# Eric Topol Writing Style Guide

This reference provides detailed analysis of Eric Topol's writing voice from his "Ground Truth" newsletter, with specific patterns to emulate for 500-word cardiology editorials.

## Core Voice Characteristics

### 1. Evidence-Obsessed Skeptic

**Pattern:** Enthusiastic about breakthroughs but relentlessly methodological

**Example structures:**
- "While the results appear promising, several questions remain unanswered..."
- "The data are compelling, yet the trial design raises concerns about..."
- "This represents a significant advance, though important caveats deserve attention..."

**Key behaviors:**
- Always cite primary sources (NEJM, JAMA, Lancet papers)
- Distinguish between correlation and causation explicitly
- Point out study limitations before celebrating results
- Question industry funding or conflicts transparently

### 2. Accessible Depth (Not Dumbed Down)

**Pattern:** Complex science explained clearly but never simplified dishonestly

**Example structures:**
- "The mechanism involves [technical term], which essentially means [explanation], leading to [outcome]"
- "To understand why this matters, consider that [technical concept]—a process where [clear explanation]"
- "The hazard ratio of 0.65 translates to a 35% relative risk reduction, but more importantly, an absolute risk reduction of just 2.3%"

**Key behaviors:**
- Define technical terms in context, not in isolation
- Use numbers meaningfully (NNT, ARR, not just p-values)
- Explain biological mechanisms when they matter
- Assume readers can handle complexity

### 3. Patient-Centered Framing

**Pattern:** Always returns to human impact, not just statistical significance

**Example structures:**
- "For a patient sitting in the clinic, this means..."
- "The quality of life implications are..."
- "Beyond the composite endpoint, patients experience..."
- "This trial addresses what patients actually care about..."

**Key behaviors:**
- Mention patient-reported outcomes explicitly
- Discuss treatment burden and acceptability
- Address disparities and access barriers
- Use "we" language (physician community serving patients)

### 4. Conversational Authority

**Pattern:** Writes as knowledgeable peer, not lecturer

**Example structures:**
- "This surprised me, given what we know about..."
- "I remain skeptical that..."
- "Having followed this literature closely..."
- "We've seen this pattern before in..."

**Key behaviors:**
- First-person observations appropriate ("This raises questions in my mind...")
- Occasional rhetorical questions ("But does this change practice?")
- Admissions of uncertainty ("The data don't yet tell us...")
- Collegial tone ("Our colleagues demonstrated...")

## Sentence Structure Patterns

### Mix of Sentence Lengths

**Short punchy sentences for emphasis:**
- "The results are clear."
- "This changes everything."
- "But there's a catch."

**Longer analytical sentences with dashes and semicolons:**
- "The intervention group showed a 25% reduction in the primary endpoint—a composite of death, MI, and stroke—though the benefit was driven entirely by the stroke component; myocardial infarction rates were identical."

**Rhythm example (mix):**
"The trial enrolled 5,000 patients. Each underwent randomization to drug X or placebo, with median follow-up of 2.5 years. The primary outcome occurred in 8.2% of the intervention group versus 11.5% of controls—an absolute risk reduction of 3.3% (NNT = 30). Impressive at first glance. But the devil, as always, resides in the details."

### Paragraph Structure

**Opening hook paragraphs (~2-3 sentences):**
Start with clinical problem or provocative statement, not trial details.

"Cardiologists have long debated whether early invasive strategy truly benefits patients with stable coronary disease. The practice patterns vary wildly across hospitals, and guidelines have equivocated. The ISCHEMIA trial, published in NEJM, promised to settle this question once and for all."

**Analytical paragraphs (variable length):**
Build arguments methodically, citing evidence as you go.

"The trial randomized over 5,000 patients with stable CAD and moderate-to-severe ischemia to either invasive management or conservative medical therapy (Smith et al., NEJM 2020). The primary outcome—a composite of cardiovascular death, MI, hospitalization for angina, or heart failure—occurred in 13.3% of the invasive group versus 15.5% of the conservative group (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.80-1.08, p=0.34). No significant difference. Yet quality of life, measured by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, favored invasive management at early time points, though this advantage diminished by 3 years (Brown et al., Circulation 2020)."

**Closing paragraphs (~2-3 sentences):**
Memorable synthesis that captures editorial stance.

"ISCHEMIA reminds us that what seems intuitive—fixing blockages must help—doesn't always bear out in rigorous trials. For most patients with stable ischemic heart disease, medical therapy remains the appropriate first-line approach. But for those with persistent symptoms despite optimal medical management, invasive options still have a role, though expectations should be tempered."

## Vocabulary and Tone

### Technical Terms in Context

**Effective pattern:**
"The trial used fractional flow reserve (FFR)—a ratio of blood flow distal to a stenosis versus the flow without obstruction—to guide intervention decisions."

**Not:**
"FFR is fractional flow reserve. It is defined as... [long definition]. The trial used FFR."

### Avoiding Unnecessary Jargon

**Better:**
"The imaging showed accumulation of amyloid protein in the heart muscle"

**Not:**
"The cardiac scintigraphy demonstrated myocardial deposition of misfolded immunoglobulin light chains"

### Measured Enthusiasm

**Appropriate:**
- "A significant advance"
- "Compelling evidence"
- "Encouraging results"
- "Noteworthy findings"

**Avoid (too hyperbolic):**
- "Game-changer"
- "Paradigm shift"
- "Revolutionary"
- "Breakthrough of the decade"

### Personal Reactions (Sparingly)

**Effective use:**
- "This surprised me, given..."
- "I remain unconvinced that..."
- "What strikes me most is..."
- "In my practice, this raises..."

**Overuse to avoid:**
Don't make every paragraph about your reactions. The data should speak first.

## Numbers and Data Presentation

### Prefer Absolute Over Relative

**Better:**
"The intervention reduced events from 12% to 8%—an absolute risk reduction of 4% (NNT = 25)"

**Not:**
"The intervention reduced events by 33% (relative risk reduction)"

Both can be mentioned, but absolute risk and NNT must be prominent.

### Confidence Intervals Matter

**Better:**
"The hazard ratio was 0.75 (95% CI 0.60-0.95), suggesting benefit, though the upper bound approaches no effect"

**Not:**
"The hazard ratio was 0.75 (p=0.02)"

### Describe Curves, Not Just Endpoints

**Effective:**
"The Kaplan-Meier curves diverged early and remained separated throughout follow-up, suggesting a sustained benefit"

**Or:**
"The curves initially overlapped, with separation only evident after 18 months—raising questions about early treatment decisions"

## Common Opening Patterns

### Pattern 1: Clinical Problem Frame

"For decades, physicians have managed [condition] with [approach], accepting [limitation] as inevitable. The [TRIAL] challenges that assumption."

**Example:**
"For decades, cardiologists have treated aortic stenosis surgically in patients well enough to tolerate operation, accepting high perioperative risk as the price of definitive therapy. The PARTNER trials challenged that assumption."

### Pattern 2: Provocative Question

"Does [intervention] truly benefit patients, or have we been intervening unnecessarily for years?"

**Example:**
"Does routine angiography and revascularization truly benefit patients with stable coronary disease, or have we been stenting unnecessarily for years?"

### Pattern 3: Data-First (Less common, but effective)

"A 40% reduction in cardiovascular death. A number needed to treat of 17. These are the kinds of results that reshape practice."

## Common Closing Patterns

### Pattern 1: Balanced Synthesis

"[TRIAL] represents a major step forward, but not the final word, in how we manage [condition]"

**Example:**
"ISCHEMIA represents a major step forward, but not the final word, in how we manage stable coronary disease."

### Pattern 2: Conditional Recommendation

"For patients who [fit profile], [intervention] should now be considered [recommendation], provided that [caveat]"

**Example:**
"For low-surgical-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis, TAVR should now be considered first-line therapy, provided that institutional expertise and appropriate patient selection are ensured."

### Pattern 3: Future-Focused

"The key question now shifts from [old question] to [new question]"

**Example:**
"The key question now shifts from whether to intervene, to which patients benefit most and what endpoints truly matter to them."

## Transition and Connection Patterns

### Between Sections

**Effective transitions:**
- "Yet the methodology raises questions..."
- "This brings us to the trial's key limitation..."
- "Context matters here..."
- "To understand the implications, we must consider..."

### Connecting to Prior Work

**Pattern:**
"These findings extend those of [earlier trial], which suggested [result] in [population]"

**Example:**
"These findings extend those of PARTNER 2, which suggested equivalence between TAVR and surgery in intermediate-risk patients."

### Contrasting with Prior Work

**Pattern:**
"Unlike [earlier trial], which found [result], the present study demonstrates [different result], likely due to [explanation]"

**Example:**
"Unlike COURAGE, which showed no mortality benefit for PCI in stable CAD, the present study enrolled patients with more severe ischemia, potentially explaining the divergent findings."

## Voice Calibration for 500-Word Format

Since Topol typically writes 1500-3500 words, adapt by:

1. **Preserve the analytical depth** - Don't sacrifice rigor for brevity
2. **Tighten each section** - Every sentence must earn its place
3. **Keep the conversational tone** - Even when compressed, remain collegial
4. **Maintain citation density** - 5-8 key references still essential
5. **One clear thesis** - Can't explore multiple angles; pick the most important

**Before compression example (Topol length):**
"The trial enrolled 5,000 patients across 300 sites. Patients were required to have stable coronary disease with moderate to severe ischemia on stress testing. The invasive strategy involved cardiac catheterization and revascularization as appropriate—either PCI or CABG. The conservative strategy emphasized optimal medical therapy, including high-dose statins, aspirin, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors. Follow-up extended for a median of 3.2 years. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, hospitalization for heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest."

**After compression for 500-word format:**
"The trial randomized 5,000 patients with stable CAD and moderate-to-severe ischemia to invasive management or optimal medical therapy, with median follow-up of 3.2 years."

## Critical Don'ts

1. **Don't hedge excessively** - Topol is appropriately cautious but not paralytically uncertain
2. **Don't use press-release language** - No "groundbreaking," "revolutionary," etc.
3. **Don't ignore industry ties** - When relevant, note funding sources and conflicts
4. **Don't forget the patient** - Every editorial should circle back to clinical impact
5. **Don't oversimplify biology** - Readers can handle mechanism discussion
6. **Don't write for laypeople** - Audience is physicians who enjoy dense concepts

## Quick Reference: Key Phrases to Use

**Expressing appropriate caution:**
- "While promising, these results require..."
- "Several important questions remain..."
- "The trial design limits our ability to..."
- "Confirmation in broader populations is needed..."

**Expressing measured enthusiasm:**
- "A significant advance in how we approach..."
- "Compelling evidence that..."

- "This fits with our emerging understanding of..."
- "We've seen this pattern before in..."

**Clinical application:**

## Final Voice Check

Before delivering editorial, ask:

1. Would Topol cite every claim with a primary source? (Yes → good)
2. Does this sound like a peer talking to peers? (Yes → good)
3. Are numbers presented with context (ARR, NNT, CIs)? (Yes → good)
4. Is the patient mentioned, not just statistics? (Yes → good)
5. Are limitations discussed as prominently as benefits? (Yes → good)
6. Is the tone balanced (not promotional or defensive)? (Yes → good)
7. Would a physician find this analytically satisfying? (Yes → good)

If any answer is "No," revise before delivery.
