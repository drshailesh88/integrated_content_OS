## Example 1: New Trial Results

### Topic: STEP-HFpEF Trial (Semaglutide for Heart Failure with Preserved EF)

---

**[TITLE]**
Semaglutide for HFpEF: The First Real Treatment Breakthrough in 20 Years

**[BODY]**

The STEP-HFpEF trial enrolled 529 patients with heart failure, preserved ejection fraction, and obesity. The results, published in NEJM in August 2023, are the most significant advance in HFpEF treatment since we started looking for one.

The headline number: a 7.8-point improvement in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) with semaglutide versus 1.5 points with placebo. That's a 6.3-point difference—well above the 5-point threshold considered clinically meaningful.

For patients who struggle to walk across a room without becoming breathless, this translates to real functional improvement.

**Why this matters more than previous HFpEF trials**

HFpEF has been the graveyard of heart failure drug development. Trial after trial—CHARM-Preserved, I-PRESERVE, TOPCAT, PARAGON-HF—showed modest or absent benefit. The only clear win before STEP-HFpEF was EMPEROR-Preserved with empagliflozin, which reduced hospitalizations but showed smaller symptom improvements.

STEP-HFpEF is different in magnitude. The KCCQ improvement is roughly double what we saw with SGLT2 inhibitors. The 6-minute walk distance increased by 21 meters—again, substantially larger than prior therapies.

**The data in detail**

| Endpoint | Semaglutide | Placebo | Difference |
|----------|-------------|---------|------------|
| KCCQ-CSS (points) | +7.8 | +1.5 | 6.3 (p<0.001) |
| 6-min walk (meters) | +21.5 | +1.2 | 20.3 (p<0.001) |
| Body weight (%) | -13.3 | -2.6 | 10.7 |
| HF hospitalization (HR) | — | — | 0.18 (0.02-0.80) |

The hospitalization reduction is remarkable—82%—though with only 8 events in the semaglutide group versus 24 in placebo, the confidence intervals are wide.

**Mechanism: Why does this work?**

Obesity and HFpEF share pathophysiology. Excess adiposity increases circulating blood volume, raises filling pressures, and promotes the diastolic dysfunction that defines HFpEF. Weight loss directly addresses these mechanics.

But is it purely weight loss, or does GLP-1 receptor agonism contribute independently?

The data suggests both. Weight loss of 10-15% consistently improves cardiac filling pressures and exercise tolerance. But GLP-1 agonists also reduce inflammation (CRP dropped 39% in STEP-HFpEF), which likely contributes to vascular and cardiac benefit.

**What this means for practice**

For patients with HFpEF and obesity (BMI ≥30), semaglutide should now be part of the conversation. The symptom benefit exceeds anything else we can offer except diuretics for acute congestion.

The caveats:
1. This was a 52-week trial. Durability beyond one year is assumed but not proven.
2. Mean BMI was 37. Benefit in patients with BMI 30-35 is plausible but less certain.
3. Cost and access remain barriers. Weekly semaglutide is expensive without coverage.

**The bottom line**

HFpEF finally has a treatment that produces substantial, patient-centered improvement. For two decades, we told patients with HFpEF that we could manage symptoms with diuretics but couldn't change the trajectory. That's no longer true.

## Example 2: Methodological Skepticism Piece

### Topic: The "Rise" of Early-Onset Cancer

---

**[TITLE]**
Early-Onset Cancer Rates Are Rising. Or Are They?

**[BODY]**

Headlines warn of an "epidemic" of cancer in young adults. Colorectal cancer under 50, breast cancer in the 30s, pancreatic cancer decades before expected. The data shows rising incidence. But before concluding that something environmental has gone terribly wrong, consider an alternative explanation: we're detecting more because we're looking more.

**The reported trend**

Early-onset colorectal cancer (diagnosis before age 50) has increased approximately 2% annually since the mid-1990s in the United States. Similar trends appear for breast, pancreatic, and kidney cancers.

These are real incidence numbers from SEER data. The trend is not disputed. The interpretation is.

**Detection vs. disease**

When incidence rises without corresponding mortality increase, the likeliest explanation is earlier or more frequent detection—not more underlying disease.

Consider what changed since the 1990s:
- Colonoscopy became widespread (previously reserved for symptoms or high-risk groups)
- Imaging utilization exploded (CT, MRI for unrelated complaints)
- Direct-to-consumer genetic testing identified high-risk individuals
- Health awareness campaigns promoted screening

Each of these shifts could increase detected cancers without any change in underlying disease rates.

**The lead-time bias problem**

If we detect a cancer 5 years earlier than we would have, incidence rises for 5 years before stabilizing. The patient would have been diagnosed eventually—we just moved the diagnosis earlier.

This creates an apparent "epidemic" that resolves when the new detection steady-state is reached.

**What the mortality data shows**

For early-onset colorectal cancer, mortality has increased modestly—but less than incidence. This pattern is consistent with:
1. Some real increase in disease (the mortality rise)
2. Substantial overdiagnosis or lead-time effect (the larger incidence rise)

If incidence doubled but mortality was flat, we'd know it was all detection. The reality is somewhere between.

[FIGURE: Plot showing CRC incidence vs. mortality trends, 1990-2020]

**The honest conclusion**

Something real is probably happening. The mortality increase, though modest, suggests genuine disease increase. Environmental factors—obesity, processed food, sedentary behavior—are plausible contributors.

But the magnitude is almost certainly overstated. When you look harder, you find more. The "cancer epidemic" framing sensationalizes a moderate trend mixed with detection artifact.

**What to do with this**

For clinicians: Consider earlier colonoscopy for symptomatic young patients. Don't dismiss GI complaints as "too young for cancer."

For public health: Acknowledge the trend but resist panic framing. Better data on stage at diagnosis would clarify how much is detection versus disease.

For patients: Awareness is reasonable; anxiety is not. The absolute risk of colorectal cancer before 50 remains low—roughly 5 per 100,000.

## Example 3: Treatment Comparison

### Topic: PCSK9 Inhibitors vs. Bempedoic Acid

---

**[TITLE]**
PCSK9 Inhibitors vs. Bempedoic Acid: Which Add-On for High LDL?

**[BODY]**

For patients who can't reach LDL targets on maximally tolerated statins, two options exist: PCSK9 inhibitors (evolocumab, alirocumab) and bempedoic acid. They're often presented as alternatives. They're not equivalent.

**The efficacy gap**

PCSK9 inhibitors reduce LDL by 50-60% on top of statin therapy. Bempedoic acid reduces LDL by approximately 18%.

[TABLE:
| Drug Class | LDL Reduction | CV Outcomes Data |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| PCSK9 inhibitors | 50-60% | FOURIER, ODYSSEY (proven) |
| Bempedoic acid | ~18% | CLEAR Outcomes (proven, smaller effect) |
]

This is not a subtle difference. A patient starting at LDL 130 on statin could reach ~55 mg/dL with PCSK9i or ~107 mg/dL with bempedoic acid.

**Cardiovascular outcomes**

FOURIER (evolocumab) and ODYSSEY OUTCOMES (alirocumab) established that PCSK9 inhibitors reduce cardiovascular events—heart attacks, strokes, coronary revascularization—by roughly 15% over 2-3 years.

CLEAR Outcomes demonstrated that bempedoic acid also reduces events—by 13%—but in a statin-intolerant population, making direct comparison difficult.

The key point: both classes work. But if the goal is maximum LDL lowering for a high-risk patient, PCSK9 inhibitors deliver more.

**When bempedoic acid makes sense**

1. **Statin intolerance**: Bempedoic acid doesn't cause myopathy (it's activated only in the liver). For genuinely statin-intolerant patients, it's an oral alternative.

2. **Cost constraints**: Bempedoic acid costs roughly $400-500/month. PCSK9 inhibitors are $400-600/month now (down from $14,000/year initially). Similar enough that this matters less than it used to.

3. **Injection aversion**: Some patients refuse injections. Bempedoic acid is a daily pill.

**When PCSK9 inhibitors are preferred**

1. **Very high-risk patients**: Prior MI, familial hypercholesterolemia, LDL significantly above target. Maximum LDL reduction matters.

2. **LDL >190 despite statin**: You need 50-60% reduction, not 18%.

3. **ASCVD recurrence despite therapy**: Aggressive secondary prevention.

**The bottom line**

PCSK9 inhibitors are more potent. Bempedoic acid is easier to take and works for statin-intolerant patients. They are not interchangeable. Choose based on how much LDL lowering you need and whether the patient tolerates statins.

For most high-risk patients who can tolerate injections, PCSK9 inhibitors remain the stronger option.
