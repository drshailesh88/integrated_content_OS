# Voice and Structure Guide

## The Two Components: Structure vs. Voice

This skill separates **structure** (how you organize and present evidence) from **voice** (how you speak to readers). You adopt Cremieux's structure while maintaining Eric Topol's voice.

---

## Cremieux's Structure (ADOPT)

### 1. Data-Forward Opening
Lead with evidence, not with "I've been thinking about..." or "Let me tell you about..."

**Cremieux pattern:**
> "Obesity rates declined for two consecutive years. For the first time in decades, the trend reversed."

**NOT:**
> "I've been following the obesity literature closely, and I think something interesting is happening."

### 2. Declarative Confidence
State conclusions directly. No excessive hedging.

**Cremieux pattern:**
> "The answer is clear: Yes, we can end the obesity epidemic with GLP-1s."

**NOT:**
> "While more research is certainly needed, the evidence seems to tentatively suggest..."

### 3. Methodological Skepticism
Question whether apparent trends are real or artifacts. Interrogate the data.

**Cremieux pattern:**
> "When a time-series suddenly jumps, the likeliest cause is a shift in how the phenomenon is measured—its definition, detection technology, reporting incentives—rather than a real-world change."

### 4. Systematic Exhaustiveness
Cover the evidence comprehensively. Don't cherry-pick.

**Cremieux pattern:**
> "With less modern GLP-1RAs like liraglutide or dulaglutide, we likely wouldn't see the rate decline by close to half, but with modern GLP-1RAs like semaglutide, more than half of obesity can be eliminated."

### 5. Visual Evidence Integration
Include charts, figures, trial data. Make the evidence visible.

## Eric Topol's Voice (MAINTAIN)

### 1. Evidence-Obsessed
Every claim grounded in cited research. No assertion without source.

**Topol pattern:**
> "The DAPA-HF trial (McMurray, NEJM 2019) demonstrated..."

### 2. Skeptical Optimism
Enthusiastic about genuine advances. Skeptical of hype.

**Topol pattern:**
> "This is a remarkable finding—if replicated. The mechanism is plausible, the effect size is meaningful, but the follow-up was short."

### 3. Patient-Centered
Always return to what matters: human impact.

**Topol pattern:**
> "For the patient sitting in front of you who can barely walk to the mailbox, this trial offers real hope."

### 4. Accessible Depth
Complex science explained clearly. Never dumbed down.

**Topol pattern:**
> "SGLT2 inhibitors work by blocking glucose reabsorption in the kidney—but their cardiac benefits appear independent of glycemic control. The mechanism likely involves effects on sodium handling and possibly ketone metabolism."

### 5. Conversational Authority
Writes as peer, not lecturer. No "one must consider..."

**Topol pattern:**
> "Here's what this actually means in practice..."
> "The bottom line is..."
> "In my experience with patients..."

### 6. Data Visualization with Meaning
Numbers used meaningfully—NNT, absolute risk, not just relative reduction.

**Topol pattern:**
> "The 20% relative risk reduction translates to an NNT of 50 over 3 years. That's roughly 1 in 50 patients benefiting from treatment."

## Voice Comparison: What to Avoid

### Cremieux's Twitter Voice (DO NOT ADOPT)

Cremieux on Twitter is:
- Sarcastic and punchy
- Willing to mock bad arguments
- Confrontational with critics
- Humorous (deadpan)
- Politically engaged in ways that generate controversy

**Example of Cremieux Twitter voice to AVOID:**
> "Googled these books and half of them have descriptions like this. This is a porn addiction."
> "It's morbidly funny when people pretend that they don't understand this rather obvious difference."

**Why avoid:** This generates engagement but undermines thought leadership positioning. You want authority through rigor, not through dunking.

### Academic Voice (DO NOT ADOPT)

Academic writing is:
- Excessively hedged
- Passive voice
- Jargon-heavy without translation
- Impersonal
- Long-winded

**Example to AVOID:**
> "It has been demonstrated in several randomized controlled trials that the administration of dapagliflozin to patients presenting with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction results in statistically significant improvements in the composite primary endpoint."

**Why avoid:** Your audience can follow rigor without suffering through academic prose.

## The Synthesis: Your Voice

Combine Cremieux's structural discipline with Topol's intellectual warmth.

### Your Pattern:

**Opening (Cremieux structure):**
> "Three consecutive trials, 45,000 patients, and the same finding: GLP-1 agonists prevent major cardiovascular events in people with obesity."

**Context (Topol voice):**
> "For decades, weight loss drugs were disappointments—effective at reducing pounds, useless or harmful for the heart. Fen-phen caused valvular disease. Sibutramine increased strokes. The FDA, reasonably, started requiring cardiovascular outcome trials for any obesity drug. What no one expected was that the latest generation would show dramatic benefit."

**Evidence (Cremieux structure + Topol accessibility):**
> "The SELECT trial (Lincoff, NEJM 2023) randomized 17,604 adults with established CVD and BMI ≥27 to semaglutide or placebo. The primary endpoint—cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke—occurred in 6.5% of the semaglutide group versus 8.0% with placebo. That's a 20% relative reduction, or about 1.5% absolute risk reduction over 3.3 years. NNT of 67."

**Methodology (Cremieux skepticism):**
> "The effect appeared early—before substantial weight loss—raising questions about mechanism. Is this a direct GLP-1 effect on vasculature? An anti-inflammatory signal? The weight loss certainly contributes, but something else is happening."

**Synthesis (Topol patient-focus):**
> "For the patient in clinic with prior MI and BMI of 32, this trial changes the conversation. Semaglutide is no longer just about weight—it's cardiovascular risk reduction."

**Conclusion (confident):**
> "The cardiovascular benefits of GLP-1 agonists are established. The mechanism remains incompletely understood. The clinical implication is clear."

## Sentence Patterns That Work

### Opening hooks:
- "[Specific data point]. [What it means]."
- "[Trial name] enrolled [N] patients. The primary endpoint was [X]. [What happened]."
- "For decades, we believed [X]. The data shows [Y]."

### Confidence patterns:
- "The evidence is clear: [conclusion]."
- "This trial settles the question of [X]."
- "The data supports [specific action] for [specific patients]."

### Methodological skepticism:
- "The apparent [trend/finding] may reflect [measurement change] rather than [real phenomenon]."
- "Before accepting this result, consider [limitation]."
- "The effect was real; the magnitude was probably overstated."

### Synthesis patterns:
- "What this means in practice is [specific implication]."
- "For patients with [profile], this changes [what]."
- "The remaining question is [specific uncertainty]."

### Closings:
- "[Clear conclusion]. [One implication]. [Optional next question]."
- "The data says [X]. The practice implication is [Y]."
- "[Summary of finding]. [What we still don't know]."
