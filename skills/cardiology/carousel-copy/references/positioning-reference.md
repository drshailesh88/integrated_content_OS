# Visual Copy Positioning Reference

Shared positioning markers and voice calibration for carousel and infographic copy.

**Review this file and modify anything that doesn't fit your voice.**

---

## Your Positioning Statement

**Who you are:** Interventional cardiologist with cath lab experience
**What you do:** Make cardiology accessible without dumbing it down
**Your edge:** You prescribe what you teach—clinical authority, not influencer advice

---

## Authority Markers for Carousels

Use 1-2 of these per carousel to signal "practicing cardiologist":

### Cath Lab / Procedural Voice
- "After thousands of angiograms..."
- "What I see in the cath lab..."
- "Before I put in a stent, I always check..."
- "In the recovery room, patients often ask..."

### Clinical Practice Voice
- "In my practice..."
- "What I tell my patients..."
- "Here's how I explain this in clinic..."
- "The question I get most often..."

### Guideline-Aware Voice
- "The guidelines say X, but clinically..."
- "Here's what the data actually shows..."
- "The cardiology community is shifting toward..."
- "This changed how we treat..."

### Evidence Voice
- "Three major trials confirm..."
- "The PARADIGM-HF trial changed everything..."
- "When you look at the numbers..."
- "HR 0.74—that's a real effect."

## Authority Markers for Infographics

Infographics don't use "I" statements. Authority comes from precision:

### Precision Signals
- Exact doses: "Carvedilol 3.125mg BID"
- Specific thresholds: "SBP <90 mmHg"
- CI and HR values: "HR 0.74 (95% CI 0.65-0.85)"
- NNT: "NNT: 21 over 18 months"

### Guideline Signals
- "Per ESC 2023"
- "ACC/AHA Class I recommendation"
- "GDMT" (guideline-directed medical therapy)

### Clinical Nuance Signals
- "(if not contraindicated)"
- "(in stable patients)"
- "(unless recent decompensation)"
- "Hold if:"
- "Monitor for:"

## Phrases to AVOID

These make you sound like a content creator, not a cardiologist:

### Generic Influencer Language
- ❌ "Listen up..."
- ❌ "This is a game-changer..."
- ❌ "Doctors hate this..."
- ❌ "The truth they don't tell you..."
- ❌ "You need to know this..."
- ❌ "This will blow your mind..."

### AI Tells
- ❌ "It's important to note that..."
- ❌ "In conclusion..."
- ❌ "This stands as a testament to..."
- ❌ "Plays a vital role in..."
- ❌ "Groundbreaking" / "Revolutionary"

### Weak Hedging
- ❌ "Studies suggest..."
- ❌ "May potentially..."
- ❌ "It appears that..."
- ❌ "Some research indicates..."

## Tone Calibration

### The Target

```
Too Casual                    YOUR VOICE                    Too Formal
─────────────────────────────────●─────────────────────────────────────
"Statins are                  "Statins reduce heart         "HMG-CoA reductase
lowkey pretty                 attacks by 25-30%.            inhibitors demonstrate
good for you"                 The evidence is clear."       efficacy in ASCVD
                                                            risk reduction."
```

### Calibration Examples

| Too Casual | Target | Too Formal |
|------------|--------|------------|
| "Your heart basically hates this" | "This increases your cardiovascular risk" | "This is associated with elevated CV morbidity" |
| "The study was huge" | "12,000 patients over 4 years" | "A large-scale multicenter randomized trial" |
| "Docs are now using this" | "This is now first-line therapy" | "This has been incorporated into treatment algorithms" |
