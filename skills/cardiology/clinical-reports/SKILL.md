# Clinical Reports

Professional clinical documentation covering case reports, diagnostic reports, trial reports, and patient documentation.

## Triggers

- User needs to write a case report
- User is documenting clinical findings
- User wants to format trial results
- User needs diagnostic report structure
- User is preparing clinical documentation

## Report Types

### 1. Case Reports (CARE Guidelines)

**Required Sections**:
| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Title | Diagnosis and intervention focus |
| Abstract | Structured: background, case, conclusion |
| Introduction | Why this case matters |

| Clinical Findings | Presentation, exam, initial assessment |
| Timeline | Chronological events |
| Diagnostic Assessment | Workup, reasoning, differentials |
| Therapeutic Intervention | Treatment details |
| Follow-up and Outcomes | Results, adherence, adverse events |
| Discussion | Context, rationale, limitations |

**HIPAA De-identification** (Remove 18 identifiers):
- Names, geographic data, dates (except year)

- LV function
- Intervention performed (if any)
- Complications
- Recommendations

**Electrophysiology Report**:

**Timeline Requirements**:
- Fatal/life-threatening: 7 days
- Other serious: 15 days

**Required Elements**:
- Event description and onset date
- Seriousness criteria met
- Causality assessment

### 4. Patient Documentation

#### SOAP Note Format
```
S (Subjective): Patient's reported symptoms, history
O (Objective): Vital signs, exam findings, test results
A (Assessment): Diagnosis, clinical reasoning
P (Plan): Treatment, follow-up, patient education
```

#### History & Physical Structure
- Chief complaint
- History of present illness

- Social history
- Review of systems
- Physical examination
- Assessment and plan

#### Discharge Summary Elements
- Admission diagnosis

- Contingency instructions

## Compliance Requirements

### Regulatory Standards
| Regulation | Applies To | Key Requirements |
|------------|------------|------------------|
| HIPAA | All US healthcare | Privacy, minimum necessary |
| 21 CFR Part 11 | Electronic records | Audit trails, signatures |
| ICH-GCP | Clinical trials | Protocol adherence, consent |
| FDA 21 CFR 312 | INDs | Safety reporting |

### Standardized Terminology
- **SNOMED CT**: Clinical terms
- **LOINC**: Laboratory tests
- **ICD-10-CM**: Diagnoses
- **CPT**: Procedures
- **RxNorm**: Medications

### Prohibited Abbreviations (Joint Commission)
| Don't Use | Problem | Use Instead |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| U | Mistaken for 0 | "unit" |
| IU | Mistaken for IV | "international unit" |
| QD, QOD | Confused | "daily," "every other day" |
| Trailing zero (1.0) | Decimal missed | 1 mg |
| No leading zero (.5) | Decimal missed | 0.5 mg |
| MS, MSO4, MgSO4 | Confused | "morphine" or "magnesium" |

## Quality Standards

### Documentation Must Be
- **Complete**: All relevant information included
- **Accurate**: Facts verified, no assumptions
- **Timely**: Documented promptly
- **Clear**: Understandable to readers
- **Compliant**: Meets regulatory requirements

### Common Deficiencies to Avoid
- Missing dates/times
- Illegible entries (if handwritten)
- Use of prohibited abbreviations
- Incomplete medication reconciliation
- Missing informed consent documentation
- Inadequate follow-up instructions

## Cardiology Case Report Considerations

### What Makes a Publishable Case
- Novel presentation of known disease
- Unexpected treatment response
- Diagnostic challenge with learning points
- Rare condition with management insights
- Adverse event with safety implications

### Key Cardiovascular Data to Include
- ECG findings (with images if relevant)
- Imaging results (echo, angiography, CT/MRI)
- Biomarkers (troponin, BNP trends)
- Hemodynamic data
- Procedural details and outcomes
- Long-term follow-up
