# Medical Newsletter Writer

Create high-quality, evidence-based medical newsletters in the style of Eric Topol's Ground Truths. This skill guides the complete newsletter creation process: from analyzing your PDF of topic ideas, to deep PubMed research, to writing in Topol's distinctive authoritative-yet-accessible voice.

## Quick Start

**Simple 3-Step Process:**

1. **Upload PDF** - Upload your PDF with topic ideas in the chat
2. **Select Topic** - Review engagement predictions and pick one topic
3. **Get Newsletter** - Receive complete, publication-ready newsletter (~3,000 words with 20-30 PubMed citations)

The skill handles everything: PDF extraction, trend analysis, PubMed research, and writing in Eric Topol's exact voice.

## Complete Workflow

The newsletter creation process has 5 phases:

1. **Extract Topics from PDF** - Read user's uploaded PDF of topic ideas
2. **Trend Analysis** - Analyze each topic for engagement potential
3. **Topic Selection** - User approves topics based on data-driven predictions  
4. **Deep Research** - Comprehensive PubMed literature review
5. **Newsletter Writing** - Write complete newsletter in Topol's style

## Phase 1: Extract Topics from PDF

### PDF Upload
User will upload a PDF containing potential newsletter topic ideas in the chat.

### Extract Topics
- Read the PDF using available tools
- Extract all topic ideas mentioned
- Clean and organize the list
- If PDF contains notes/context about topics, capture that too

## Phase 2: Trend Analysis & Engagement Prediction

### Analyze Each Topic (Automatically)

For each topic extracted from the PDF, conduct comprehensive trend analysis:

**1. News Coverage (Google News, medical news sites)**
- Search past 30 days
- Note which outlets covering
- Identify breaking developments
- Count article frequency

**2. Search Interest**
- Use web_search to assess current discussion
- Look for rising interest signals
- Note if topic is trending

**3. Social Media Signals**
- YouTube: Search for videos, note view counts
- Check if medical professionals are discussing
- Assess virality potential

**4. Academic Momentum (PubMed)**
- Count recent publications (6 months)
- Check for major journal coverage
- Identify ongoing trials
- Note if field is active

### Engagement Prediction Scoring

For each topic, score 1-10 on:

1. **Readability**: Can this be explained clearly to physicians?
2. **Controversy**: Is there debate/opposing views?
3. **Clinical Relevance**: Will this affect patient care?
4. **Timeliness**: How current is this? Breaking news?
5. **Share Potential**: Will physicians share with colleagues?

**Overall Engagement Score** = Average of 5 metrics

### Present Analysis

Create comparison table with:
- Topic name
- Brief trend summary (2-3 sentences)
- Individual scores (1-10)
- Overall engagement score
- Priority recommendation (High/Medium/Low)

Sort by overall score, present top 5-10 topics to user.

## Phase 3: Topic Selection

Present findings to user with:
- Top topics by engagement prediction
- Rationale for scores
- Notable timeliness factors

**User selects ONE topic** - then the skill automatically proceeds to research and writing.

## Phase 4: Deep Research (Automatic)

### PubMed Search Strategy

Before searching, read **workflow.md** for detailed research guidance.

**Initial searches:**
1. Broad topic overview
2. Recent findings (<1 year)  
3. Systematic reviews/meta-analyses
4. Major clinical trials

**Paper Prioritization:**
- Tier 1: Large RCTs in NEJM, Lancet, JAMA, Science, Nature
- Tier 2: Meta-analyses and systematic reviews
- Tier 3: Large observational studies
- Tier 4: Mechanistic studies in high-impact journals
- Tier 5: Pre-clinical (use sparingly)

**Target:** 15-30 highly relevant papers

### Extract Key Information

For each major paper:
- Study design and sample size
- Key findings (quantitative)
- Limitations
- How it fits the narrative
- Potential quotes/figures

### Find Related Work
- Use PubMed related articles
- Check major paper citations
- Look for responses/commentary
- Identify consensus vs. controversy

## Phase 5: Newsletter Writing (Automatic)

### Before Writing

**CRITICAL: Read topol-style-guide.md first** - This contains essential voice patterns, phrases, and stylistic requirements.

### Structure

**Opening (1-2 paragraphs)**
- Hook using Topol's opening patterns (see style guide)
- Why this matters NOW
- What will be covered

**Background/Context (optional)**
- Define key terms: "To review: [term] is..."
- Historical perspective if relevant
- Current state of field

**Main Content (3-5 sections with clear headers)**
- Each section = one major subtopic
- Build logically
- Include data/studies in each
- Use tables to compare studies/treatments
- Reference figures from papers

**Implications/Future Directions**
- What this means for practice
- Research gaps
- What's next

**Bottom Line (required)**
- Synthesize key takeaways
- Clear conclusions based on evidence
- Call for more evidence if needed

**Standard Closing (required)**

## Essential References

**ALWAYS READ BEFORE WRITING:**
- **topol-style-guide.md** - Complete guide to Topol's voice, phrases, patterns
- **workflow.md** - Detailed research and writing process

## Key Success Factors

1. **Evidence-based**: Every claim must be cited
2. **Critical thinking**: Discuss limitations, not just positives
3. **Voice consistency**: Sound like Topol throughout
4. **Comprehensive**: Cover topic thoroughly with multiple studies
5. **Accessible**: Technical accuracy without excessive jargon
6. **Timely**: Focus on recent developments

## Example Opening Lines (Topol Style)

- "In fielding questions recently from patients and colleagues about [topic], I was prompted to look into the field at more depth."
- "[Term] was coined in the late [year]. Now, about [X] years later, we've yet to achieve [goal]."
- "This week [major development] was published in [journal]. Several important reports have since been published. I've incorporated them in this updated version."
- "There's no question that the use of [intervention] has surged, in part because of [claims], along with endorsements by [influencers]."

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't rely on single studies - use multiple sources
- Don't ignore study limitations - they're critical
- Don't cherry-pick data - present full picture
- Don't get too technical - stay accessible
- Don't use bullet points excessively - prefer prose
- Don't skip the critical analysis - it's essential
- Don't forget visual elements - tables enhance understanding
- Don't deviate from Topol's voice - consistency matters
