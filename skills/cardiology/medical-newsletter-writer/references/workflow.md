# Newsletter Creation Workflow

This document outlines the complete workflow for creating evidence-based medical newsletters in Eric Topol's style.

## Phase 1: Topic Discovery & Trend Analysis

### Step 1.1: Gather Seed Topics
- User provides list of potential newsletter topics
- Topics can be from any source (news, papers, ideas, clinical questions)
- No minimum/maximum number

### Step 1.2: Conduct Trend Analysis
For each seed topic, analyze:

#### News Trends
- Search Google News for recent articles (past 30 days)
- Identify breaking medical news
- Note frequency of coverage
- Track which outlets are covering

#### Search Volume
- Assess Google Trends data if available
- Look for rising search interest
- Note geographic concentration
- Identify related queries

#### Social Media Signals
- YouTube: Search for recent videos, note view counts
- X/Twitter: Look for discussion volume
- Medical Twitter: Check if topic is trending among physicians
- LinkedIn: Note if medical professionals are discussing

#### Academic Momentum
- PubMed search: Count recent publications (past 6 months)
- Note if major journals are publishing
- Check for clinical trials registered
- Identify if new research is emerging

### Step 1.3: Engagement Prediction
For each topic, create a predictive score based on:

**Readability Score (1-10)**
- Can this be explained clearly?
- Is it too technical for general medical audience?
- Are there relatable analogies?

**Controversy Score (1-10)**
- Is there debate in the field?
- Are there opposing viewpoints?
- Will this generate discussion?

**Clinical Relevance (1-10)**
- Does this affect patient care?
- Is this actionable for physicians?
- Will readers encounter this in practice?

**Timeliness (1-10)**
- How current is this topic?
- Is there breaking news?
- Is a major trial result pending?

**Share Potential (1-10)**
- Will physicians share this with colleagues?
- Does it challenge conventional wisdom?
- Is there a "wow" factor?

**Overall Engagement Score**: Average of above metrics

### Step 1.4: Present Analysis
Create a comparison table showing:
- Topic name
- Key news/trend summary (2-3 sentences)
- Individual scores
- Overall engagement prediction
- Recommended priority (High/Medium/Low)

Sort by engagement score descending.

## Phase 2: Topic Selection

### Present Findings
- Show top 5-10 topics by predicted engagement
- Include rationale for each score
- Note any topics with exceptional timeliness

### User Approval
- User selects topic(s) for newsletter
- User may combine related topics
- User confirms target length/scope

## Phase 3: Deep Research

### Step 3.1: PubMed Literature Search

#### Initial Search Strategy
- Broad search for topic overview
- Narrow search for recent findings (<1 year)
- Search for systematic reviews/meta-analyses
- Search for major clinical trials

#### Search Terms
- Use MeSH terms when appropriate
- Include variations (acronyms, full names)
- Use filters: publication date, article type
- Target: 20-50 relevant papers initially

#### Paper Prioritization
1. **Tier 1**: Large RCTs in major journals (NEJM, Lancet, JAMA, Science, Nature)
2. **Tier 2**: Meta-analyses and systematic reviews
3. **Tier 3**: Large observational studies
4. **Tier 4**: Mechanistic studies in high-impact journals
5. **Tier 5**: Pre-clinical research (use sparingly)

### Step 3.2: Full-Text Analysis
For key papers:
- Read abstract and conclusions
- Identify sample size, design, endpoints
- Note limitations explicitly stated
- Extract key figures/tables
- Save for potential inclusion in newsletter

### Step 3.3: Related Citations
- Use PubMed "Related Articles" feature
- Check citations in key papers
- Look for response papers or commentary
- Identify consensus vs. controversy

### Step 3.4: Research Documentation
Create structured notes with:
- Paper citation (authors, journal, year)
- Study design and sample size
- Key findings (quantitative when possible)
- Limitations
- How it fits the narrative
- Direct quote-worthy passages

## Phase 4: Newsletter Composition

### Step 4.1: Outline Creation
Based on research, create structure:

1. **Opening** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Hook using one of Topol's opening patterns
   - Why this matters now
   - What will be covered

2. **Background/Context** (optional section)
   - Define key terms
   - Historical perspective if relevant
   - Current state of field

3. **Main Content** (3-5 sections)
   - Each section = one major subtopic
   - Build logically from one to next
   - Include data/studies in each section

4. **Implications/Future Directions**
   - What this means for practice
   - Research gaps
   - What's coming next

5. **Bottom Line**
   - Synthesize key takeaways
   - Clear conclusions
   - Call for evidence/action if appropriate

### Step 4.2: Writing Guidelines

**Style Requirements**:
- Read topol-style-guide.md before writing
- Match his voice patterns
- Use first person naturally
- Maintain critical, evidence-based tone

**Citation Requirements**:
- Every factual claim needs citation
- Link to original studies
- Use hyperlinked text (not footnotes)
- Format: "[link text](URL)" or "study showed [link](URL)"
- Prefer: Author names + journal when introducing major findings

**Visual Elements**:
- Create or describe tables comparing studies/treatments
- Reference figures from papers (describe them)
- Use clear section headers
- Consider including comparison graphics

**Length Target**:
- Aim for 2,000-3,500 words
- Comprehensive but readable
- Every paragraph should advance understanding

### Step 4.3: Critical Analysis

**Include Throughout**:
- Study limitations
- Conflicts of interest if relevant
- Evidence gaps
- Alternative interpretations
- Degree of certainty

**Questions to Address**:
- What's the quality of evidence?
- What are we still uncertain about?
- Are there conflicting findings?
- What would change our understanding?

### Step 4.4: Draft Review

Before finalizing, check:
- [ ] Opens with engaging hook?
- [ ] Clear why-this-matters framing?
- [ ] Every claim cited with hyperlink?
- [ ] Limitations discussed?
- [ ] Topol's voice maintained?
- [ ] Tables/figures described/included?
- [ ] Sections flow logically?
- [ ] "Bottom Line" section present?
- [ ] Standard closing included?
- [ ] Length appropriate (2,000-3,500 words)?
- [ ] Accessible to physician audience?

## Phase 5: Formatting & Delivery

### Markdown Format
- Use ## for section headers
- Use **bold** for key terms (sparingly)
- Use [link text](URL) for citations
- Include image markdown if describing figures
- Use > for block quotes if including any

### Standard Closing
Always include Topol's standard closing:

```

## Quality Standards

### Evidence Quality
- Prefer large, well-designed studies
- Note when evidence is preliminary
- Flag when claims exceed evidence
- Cite systematic reviews when available

### Writing Quality
- Clear, active voice
- Technical accuracy without jargon
- Accessible to physicians, not just specialists
- Engaging narrative flow

### Citation Quality  
- Original sources, not news summaries
- Links work (verify before publishing)
- Appropriate study types for claims made
- Recent publications prioritized

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-reliance on single study**: Use multiple sources
2. **Ignoring limitations**: Every study has them
3. **Cherry-picking data**: Present full picture
4. **Too technical**: Remember audience
5. **Missing context**: Connect to bigger picture
6. **Weak opening**: Hook reader immediately
7. **No visual elements**: Tables/figures enhance understanding
8. **Inconsistent voice**: Stay in Topol's style throughout
9. **Under-citing**: When in doubt, cite
10. **Ignoring controversy**: Address conflicting evidence
