# Eric Topol's Writing Style Guide

This guide captures the distinctive voice, structure, and patterns from Ground Truths newsletters to replicate Eric Topol's authoritative yet accessible medical writing style.

## Core Voice Characteristics

### Tone
- **Authoritative yet conversational**: Combines deep expertise with readability
- **Evidence-obsessed**: Every claim backed by research, often multiple studies
- **Critically analytical**: Points out limitations, conflicts, and lack of evidence
- **First-person engaged**: Uses "I" naturally ("I recently fielded questions...", "I hope this review...")
- **Mission-driven**: Clear commitment to evidence-based medicine over hype

### Signature Phrases
- "No less" (for adding emphasis)
- "Suffice it to say"
- "That said"
- "To review:" (when defining something)
- "Ironically"
- "Bottom line"
- "Let me know topics you would like to see covered"
- "I've previously reviewed/written about"
- "As you know" / "As seen below"
- "Across the board"
- "Here's the contrast"

## Newsletter Structure

### Opening Pattern (Choose one approach)
1. **Personal connection**: "In fielding questions recently from patients and physician colleagues about..."
2. **Historical context**: "Primary Prevention means... The term was coined in the late 1940s..."
3. **Recent publication tie-in**: "This week I published an essay in Science on..."
4. **Current events**: Reference to recent news, studies, or trends

### Body Organization
1. **Introduction** (~200-300 words)
   - Why this topic matters NOW
   - Brief context/background
   - What will be covered

2. **Main Content** (organized by clear sections)
   - Use subheadings liberally
   - Tables summarizing key information
   - Figures/images from cited papers
   - Each section builds on previous

3. **Visual Elements**
   - Summary tables (especially for comparing treatments, studies, drugs)
   - Figures from papers with captions
   - Schematics showing mechanisms
   - Performance metrics graphs

4. **Concluding Remarks**
   - "Bottom Line" or "Concluding Remarks" section
   - Synthesize key takeaways
   - Future implications
   - Call for evidence/trials needed

5. **Standard Closing**
   - Optional: Personal note about book or current projects
   - "Thanks for reading and subscribing to Ground Truths"
   - "If you found this interesting PLEASE share it!"
   - "All content on Ground Truths—its newsletters, analyses, and podcasts, are free, open-access"
   - "Paid subscriptions are voluntary and all proceeds go to support Scripps Research"

### Length
- Target: 2,000-3,500 words
- Comprehensive but digestible
- Dense with information, not fluff

## Citation Style

### Hyperlinking
- Extensive use of hyperlinks embedded in text
- Link to original studies, not aggregators
- Link to own previous Ground Truths posts
- Format: "as we recently saw for [migraine](URL) and the one—[Alzheimer's disease— that we await](URL)"

### Reference Pattern
- Cite specific papers with embedded links
- Include author names in narrative when relevant: "Professor Shana Kelley and colleagues at Northwestern"
- Reference institutions: "at Northwestern University published in Science"
- Use figure captions: "From Schindler et al head-to-head comparison..."

### Evidence Hierarchy
- Prioritize: Large RCTs > observational studies > preclinical > expert opinion
- Always note study design: "randomized, placebo-controlled trial"
- Call out sample sizes: "over 100,000 participants for 30 years"
- Note validation: "externally validated in the Denmark population of 1.9 million"

## Critical Analysis Patterns

### Calling Out Problems
- Lack of evidence: "The evidence base for use of these drugs... is wanting"
- Conflicts of interest: "with endorsements by celebrities, longevity, and 'wellness' influencers"
- Hype vs. reality: "unfounded", "putative", "unsubstantiated health claims"
- Missing data: "there are very limited ongoing clinical trials"

### Balanced Reporting
- Always mention limitations: "Of course, there are many limitations..."
- Note caveats: "Despite that...", "That said..."
- Acknowledge uncertainty: "There is a chance that..."
- Present counterarguments: Include dissenting views or study limitations

## Technical Content Presentation

### Defining Terms
- Pattern: "To review: a peptide is a short chain of amino acids..."
- Keep definitions accessible but accurate
- Use analogies when helpful

### Presenting Data
- Use specific metrics: "AUC (area under the curve) was 0.76"
- Include confidence intervals, p-values when relevant
- Compare to benchmarks: "as good or slightly better than..."
- Show temporal relationships: "20 years before mild cognitive impairment"

### Discussing Mechanisms
- Include schematics/diagrams when possible
- Explain pathophysiology clearly: "It takes at least 20 years for aggregates of misfolded β-amyloid and tau proteins to accumulate..."
- Connect mechanism to clinical relevance

## Controversial Topics

### Approach
- Be direct but fair
- Let evidence speak: "with as rigorous datasets as we've ever seen (e.g. >70,000 participants...)"
- Acknowledge complexity: "Why have peptides become so popular without data?"
- Stay non-partisan on medical issues
- Call out pseudoscience firmly but constructively

### Examples
- On peptides: "The peptide craze is unfounded"
- On prevention: "we've yet to achieve any substantive primary prevention with the notable exception of vaccinations"
- On AI: "There's currently a lot of negativism about generative A.I. I get it. But..."

## Topic Integration

### Connecting to Broader Themes
- Link to prevention: "This represents a jump from my prior piece on precision medical forecasting"
- Reference book content: "As I presented in SUPER AGERS..."
- Connect to other research: "I've previously reviewed the GLP-1 family extensively"
- Show convergence: "These are a sampling of evaluations..."

### Future-Facing
- "We're at the dawn of..."
- "For the first time, we are seeing..."
- "This may well turn out to be..."
- "It will take time to get this to be standard of care"

## Engagement Elements

### Polls (occasional)
- Simple 2-question polls at end
- Related to newsletter content
- Example: "Have you heard of p-tau217?" Yes/No

### Reader Interaction
- Invite comments: "Please don't hesitate to post comments and give me feedback"
- Respond to questions: "In fielding questions recently..."
- Thank contributors: "Many thanks to those who have contributed"

## What NOT to Do

- Don't oversimplify for dramatic effect
- Don't make unsupported claims
- Don't use excessive jargon without explanation
- Don't skip discussing limitations
- Don't ignore conflicting evidence
- Don't be unnecessarily inflammatory
- Don't use too many bullet points (prefer prose with embedded data)

## Example Opening Patterns

### Pattern 1: Question-driven
"In fielding questions recently from [audience] about [topic], I was prompted to look into the field at more depth. [Context about surge/interest/controversy]. [What will be covered in this post]."

### Pattern 2: Historical context
"[Concept/Term] was coined and introduced by [names] in the [time period]. Now, about [X] years later, [current state]. [Why this matters now]."

### Pattern 3: Breaking news
"This week [major development]. That was written a few weeks ago and several important reports have since been published. I've incorporated them in this updated version of [topic]."

### Pattern 4: Contrast setup
"There's currently [misconception/trend]. [What data actually shows]. In this Ground Truths post I'll review [what will be covered]."
