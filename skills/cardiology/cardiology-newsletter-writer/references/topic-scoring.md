## Regional Relevance Modifier (India-Specific)

Add bonus points (+5 to +10) if:
- Addresses health burden specific to India (e.g., young MI, rheumatic heart disease)
- Cost-effectiveness angle relevant to Indian healthcare
- Indian sites/investigators involved
- Addresses India cardiovascular epidemic themes
- Relevant to Indian dietary/lifestyle patterns

## Audience Appeal Factors

Consider and note (but don't score separately):

**For referring physicians:**
- When to refer for intervention
- Risk stratification tools
- Medical vs. interventional approaches
- Patient selection criteria

**For peers:**
- Technical procedural details
- Device comparisons
- Complication management
- Challenging cases

**For juniors/fellows:**
- Educational value
- Foundational knowledge
- Career-relevant developments
- Training implications

## Final Scoring

**80-100: Must include**
- Top tier journal + directly relevant + practice-changing + trending
- Example: NEJM trial showing TAVR superior to SAVR in low-risk with high buzz

**60-79: Strong candidate**
- Mix of high scores across categories
- Include if space permits or ties to other topics

**40-59: Consider**
- May include if unique angle or connects topics
- Good for rounding out newsletter

**<40: Skip**
- Unless exceptionally relevant to user's specific practice
- Better topics likely available

## Presentation Format

When presenting scored topics to user, format as table:

| Topic/Trial | Journal | Date | Engagement Score | Key Findings | Why It Matters |
|-------------|---------|------|------------------|--------------|----------------|
| EXAMPLE-TRIAL | NEJM | Jan 2025 | 85 | Drug X reduced MACE by 25% vs placebo | First novel antiplatelet in decade, may change practice |

Include:
- Breakdown of score components in parentheses (e.g., "85 (Journal:25, Relevance:25, Impact:20, Trending:15)")
- 1-2 sentence summary of findings
- Brief "why interventional cardiologists care" statement

## Predictive Analytics

For each topic, estimate:

**Predicted views:** Low (<500) / Medium (500-2000) / High (2000-5000) / Viral (>5000)

Based on:
- Similar past newsletter performance
- Current trending topics in cardiology
- Shareability factors (surprising results, practice-changing, controversial)

**Predicted shares:** Low (<10) / Medium (10-50) / High (50-200) / Viral (>200)

Based on:
- "Water cooler" factor (will cardiologists discuss?)
- Social media-friendly aspects
- Debate potential

**Subscriber conversion potential:** Low / Medium / High

Based on:
- Topic demonstrates expertise
- Provides unique analysis
- Solves common clinical dilemma
- Shows thought leadership
