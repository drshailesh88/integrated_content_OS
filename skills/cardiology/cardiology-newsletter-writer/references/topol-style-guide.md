# Eric Topol Writing Style Guide

Based on analysis of Ground Truths newsletters. Use this guide meticulously when drafting.

## Voice and Tone

**Authoritative but accessible**: Topol writes with the confidence of deep expertise but makes complex science understandable. He's not condescending—he assumes intelligent readers.

**Analytical and evidence-driven**: Every claim is backed by data. He cites specific numbers, trial designs, methodologies. Never vague.

**Enthusiastic about breakthroughs**: When genuinely excited about advances, it shows. But tempered with critical analysis of limitations.

**Skeptical of hype**: Quick to point out when claims aren't backed by evidence (see his peptide craze piece). Calls out misleading marketing and poor science.

**Forward-looking**: Often ends with implications, what's next, open questions. Not just "what happened" but "what this means."

## Structural Patterns

**Opening hook**: Start with the most important/exciting development. Often leads with a new study, then contextualizes.

Example: "This week I published an essay in the journal Science on the exciting potential to get ahead of Alzheimer's disease."

**Build context progressively**: Background → Current development → Deep dive → Implications

**Smooth topic transitions**: Connect disparate topics via shared themes:
- "On another front..." (shifting to related area)
- "Beyond the hundreds of plasma proteins..." (expanding scope)
- Link via mechanism, population, technology

**Natural paragraph flow**: Long paragraphs (5-8 sentences) are common. Dense with information but readable.

**Visual integration**: Uses figures/images extensively with clear captions. References them naturally in text.

## Language Characteristics

**Specific data points**:
- "92% of individuals with positive blood-test results..."
- "following more than 100,000 participants for 30 years"
- "AUC was 0.76"
- Always includes actual numbers, not "significant increase"

**Technical precision**:
- Uses proper terminology: "p-tau217 (tau phosphorylated at threonine-217)"
- Includes mechanisms: "DNA methylation can serve as a kind of clock"
- Trial names and acronyms: "PARTNER 3," "Delphi-2M"

**Parenthetical context**:
- Uses parentheticals to add detail without breaking flow
- "(I wrote about this breakthrough test in a previous Ground Truths.)"
- "(see below)"

**Active voice dominant**: Mostly active constructions. Passive when discussing study designs.

**Varied sentence length**: Mixes short punchy sentences with longer analytical ones.

## What Topol Does NOT Do

❌ No promotional language: Never "stands as," "plays a vital role," "testament to"
❌ No editorializing crutches: Never "it's important to note," "one must remember"
❌ No summary endings: Never "In conclusion" or "In summary"
❌ No bullet point overuse: Prefers prose. Uses lists sparingly for data points
❌ No excessive bolding: Bolds sparingly—maybe 2-3 terms per 1000 words
❌ No formulaic transitions: Avoids "moreover," "furthermore," "in addition"
❌ No vague attributions: Always cites specific journals, studies, researchers
❌ No artificial enthusiasm: Excitement is genuine and earned by the data

## Citation Style

**Inline references**: "As reported in NEJM 2025"
**Natural integration**: "A recent NEJM study showed..."
**Trial acronyms**: "The PARTNER 3 trial enrolled..."
**Author attribution**: "Professor Shana Kelley and colleagues at Northwestern"
**Figure references**: "(Figure below)" or "(see below)"

## Sentence-Level Examples

**Good (Topol-like):**
> "The trial enrolled 1,500 patients across 50 sites, showing a 15% reduction in MACE at 5 years. Subgroup analysis revealed higher efficacy in low-risk patients, though baseline differences warrant caution."

**Bad (AI-like):**
> "This landmark trial stands as a testament to the important role of early intervention. The results are significant, highlighting the need for further research. It's important to note that more studies are needed."

**Good transition:**
> "The results align with prior data from PARTNER 1 and 2, though the younger patient population in PARTNER 3 introduces new considerations for guideline development."

**Bad transition:**
> "Furthermore, it is worth noting that these findings, in addition to previous research, moreover demonstrate the significant importance of this approach."

## Topic Development Pattern

1. **Lead with finding**: "A new study showed [specific result]"
2. **Add context**: "This builds on prior work showing..."
3. **Explain methodology**: "The trial enrolled X patients with Y characteristics"
4. **Present results**: Specific numbers, endpoints, comparisons
5. **Analyze critically**: Limitations, biases, open questions
6. **Implication**: What this means for practice/future research

## Authentic Topol Phrases (Use Sparingly)

- "There's no question that..."
- "No less, there's..."
- "Suffice it to say..."
- "Of course, there are many limitations..."
- "Here's the contrast..."
- "At the same time..."
- "This is where..."
- "BTW..." (very casual, in closing sections)

## Red Flags (Never Use)

- "It stands as a testament to"
- "Plays a pivotal role"
- "Continues to captivate"
- "Nestled in"
- "A rich tapestry"
- "One must consider"
- "No discussion would be complete without"
- "In conclusion, we can see that"
- "The results clearly demonstrate"
- "This exciting development promises"

## For Cardiology Context

**Interventional focus**: When discussing trials, note procedural implications
**Risk stratification**: Often discusses patient populations by risk (high, intermediate, low)
**Comparative effectiveness**: Compares new approaches to established ones
**Guideline implications**: Considers how findings might shift practice guidelines
**Technology evolution**: Notes advances in devices, techniques, imaging
**Transitions**: Link topics via shared patient populations, risk factors, or technologies

Example transition: "While TAVR advances continue in lower-risk populations, parallel developments in coronary interventions are addressing similar challenges in patient selection and procedural refinement."
