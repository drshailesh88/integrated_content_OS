# Anti-AI Detection Guidelines

These rules MUST be followed to ensure newsletter sounds authentically human. Review before and during drafting.

## Critical Language Rules

### AVOID - Promotional/Puffery Phrases
Never use:
- "stands as / serves as / is a testament"
- "plays a vital/significant/pivotal role"
- "continues to captivate"
- "leaves a lasting impact"
- "rich heritage/tapestry"
- "nestled in"
- "breathtaking," "must-visit," "stunning"
- "enduring legacy"

✅ USE instead: Specific, factual descriptions
- "The trial enrolled 1,500 patients across 50 sites, showing a 15% reduction in MACE"
- "Results demonstrated a statistically significant improvement"

### AVOID - Editorializing Phrases
Never use:
- "it's important to note/remember/consider"
- "it is worth noting"
- "one must remember/consider"
- "we should note that"
- "no discussion would be complete without"

✅ USE instead: Present facts directly
- "The subgroup analysis revealed higher efficacy in low-risk patients"
- "Baseline differences warrant caution"

### AVOID - Overused Conjunctions
Minimize these transitions:
- "moreover"
- "furthermore"
- "in addition"
- "on the other hand" (OK occasionally)
- "additionally"

✅ USE instead: Varied transitions
- "The results align with prior data, though..."
- "At the same time..."
- "Beyond this..."
- "Parallel developments..."
- "This finding complements..."

### AVOID - Section Summaries
Never end with:
- "In summary,"
- "In conclusion,"
- "Overall,"
- "To summarize,"
- "In short,"

✅ USE instead: End with implications or open questions
- "These findings may shift guidelines toward earlier intervention"
- "The long-term durability of these results remains to be seen"
- "Whether this benefit extends to higher-risk populations awaits further study"

### AVOID - Formulaic Challenge Sections
Never use pattern: "Despite its [positives], [subject] faces challenges…" + speculation

✅ USE instead: Integrate limitations naturally throughout
- "Enrollment biases could limit generalizability to diverse populations"
- "The trial excluded patients with severe renal dysfunction"
- "Follow-up duration of 2 years may be insufficient to capture late events"

## Style Rules

### Headings
✅ USE: Sentence case
- "Key takeaways from PARTNER 3"
- "New data on TAVR in low-risk patients"

❌ AVOID: Title Case or ALL CAPS
- "Key Takeaways From PARTNER 3"
- "NEW DATA ON TAVR"

### Bold Text
✅ USE: Sparingly, only for key terms on first mention
- First mention of trial name
- First mention of primary endpoint
- Maximum 2-3 bolds per 1000 words

❌ AVOID: Excessive boldface throughout

### Lists and Bullets
✅ USE: Only when essential for:
- Trial endpoints
- Direct comparisons
- Study inclusion/exclusion criteria

❌ AVOID: 
- Narrative content in bullet points
- Lists of findings (use prose)
- Conclusion points (use prose)

**Prefer flowing paragraphs**. When bullets are necessary, each point should be 1-2 complete sentences minimum.

### Punctuation
✅ VARY: Don't overuse em-dashes
- Use commas, semicolons, periods
- Em-dash OK occasionally for emphasis

## Analytical Writing Rules

### AVOID - Superficial Analysis with -ing Phrases
❌ BAD: "The study found a 20% increase, highlighting the importance of early detection"
❌ BAD: "Results showed improvement, demonstrating the efficacy of the intervention"

✅ GOOD: "The study found a 20% increase in event-free survival at 5 years"
✅ GOOD: "Results showed 23% relative risk reduction (95% CI 1.15-1.32, p=0.003)"

### AVOID - Vague Attributions
❌ BAD: "Industry reports suggest..."
❌ BAD: "Experts believe..."
❌ BAD: "Studies have shown..."

✅ GOOD: "As reported in NEJM 2025, investigators found..."
✅ GOOD: "The PARTNER 3 trial demonstrated..."
✅ GOOD: "Data from the UK Biobank revealed..."

### AVOID - False Ranges
❌ BAD: "Benefits range from improved outcomes to better quality of life"
(Only use ranges if the original source used them)

✅ GOOD: "Primary endpoints included MACE, stroke, and rehospitalization"
✅ GOOD: "HbA1c reduction ranged from 0.8% to 1.2%" (if this is actual data)

### CRITICAL - Direct Contrast Rule
**Delete these contrast patterns:**
- "This isn't about X—it's about Y"
- "Rather than X, focus on Y"
- "instead of"
- "but rather"

If contrast is needed, space it out with 2-3+ sentences using expansion:
❌ BAD: "Rather than focusing on symptom relief, the trial aimed to reduce mortality"

✅ GOOD: "The trial's primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 5 years. This represented a departure from earlier studies that had focused on symptom relief and quality of life measures. Investigators reasoned that hard endpoints would provide clearer evidence for guideline development."

## Sentence Structure

### Vary Sentence Length
- Mix short punchy sentences (5-10 words)
- Medium analytical sentences (15-25 words)
- Longer complex sentences (30-40 words) sparingly

### Avoid Repetitive Patterns
Don't start multiple consecutive sentences the same way:
❌ "The study showed... The results demonstrated... The findings indicated..."

✅ Vary openers: "Investigators enrolled... Results showed... At 5-year follow-up... Among high-risk patients..."

### Use Active Voice (Mostly)
✅ "Investigators enrolled 1,500 patients"
✅ "The trial demonstrated significant benefit"

Passive OK for: "Patients were randomized 1:1"

## Verification Checklist

Before finalizing newsletter, check:

- [ ] No promotional phrases (stands as, vital role, testament)
- [ ] No editorializing crutches (important to note, worth noting)
- [ ] No summary endings (in conclusion, overall)
- [ ] Sentence case in all headings
- [ ] Bold text ≤3 uses per 1000 words
- [ ] Lists only where essential
- [ ] No direct contrasts without 2-3 sentence spacing
- [ ] All attributions specific with sources
- [ ] No vague ranges or benefits
- [ ] No superficial -ing phrase analysis
- [ ] Varied sentence structure and length
- [ ] Positive assertions, not "instead of" patterns
- [ ] Transitions varied (not moreover/furthermore/in addition)

## Example: Bad vs Good

### BAD (AI-detected)
> "The PARTNER 3 trial stands as a landmark study in TAVR development. It's important to note that this research plays a vital role in expanding treatment options. Moreover, the findings highlight the importance of patient selection. Furthermore, the results demonstrate significant benefits. In conclusion, this trial will have a lasting impact on cardiovascular care."

**Problems:**
- "stands as a landmark study" (promotional)
- "it's important to note" (editorializing)
- "plays a vital role" (puffery)
- "moreover," "furthermore" (overused conjunctions)
- "in conclusion" (summary ending)
- Generic, no specific data

### GOOD (Human-sounding)
> "The PARTNER 3 trial enrolled 1,000 low-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis across 71 centers, comparing TAVR with surgical valve replacement. At 2 years, the composite endpoint of death, stroke, or rehospitalization occurred in 8.5% of TAVR patients versus 15.1% of surgical patients (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.37-0.79, p=0.001). These findings extend prior data from intermediate and high-risk populations, though longer follow-up will be essential to assess valve durability. The trial may accelerate TAVR adoption in younger, healthier patients, particularly as newer-generation devices address paravalvular leak concerns."

**Why it works:**
- Specific enrollment data
- Actual results with statistics
- Critical analysis (durability question)
- Forward-looking implication
- Natural transitions
- Physician-level technical detail
- No AI red-flag phrases
